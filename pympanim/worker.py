    Attributes:

        TRAINED:

        frames_per_sync (int): the number of frames before we ask workers to
            sync. Larger numbers give less feedback about how the workers
            are doing but waste less time. this is typically annealed
            upward to max_frames_per_sync.
        num_workers (int): the number of worker threads. the key variable.
            Defaults to 1/3 the number of physical cores.
        frame_batch_amount (int): the number of sequential frames sent to
            each worker. Sequential frames are sometimes faster to calculate.

        UNTRAINED:

        window_size (float): the number of seconds that a performance window
            lasts. Must not be 0.
        perf_delay (float): the number of seconds before we expect a parameter
            change to have some effect on performance. Can be 0
        max_workers (int): the maximum number of threads generating images,
            defaults to 2/3 number of physical cores
        spawn_worker_threshold_low (float): the percentage of frames received
            that are processed by the image thread in a given amount of time
            that triggers spawning another worker when we have have appreciably
            below the ooo_balance number of frames.

            For example, 0.8 means that if we processed 80% or more of the frames
            we received in a given window in that same window, we should spawn
            another worker.
        spawn_worker_threshold_high (float): analgous to the previous, except
            this is the threshold used when we have an acceptable number of
            out of order frames. For example, 1.2 means if we processed 120%
            of the frames received in a given window, we should spawn naother
            thread in anticipation of the number of ooo frames falling
        kill_worker_threshold_low (float): the percentage of frames received
            that are processed by the image thread in a given amount of time
            that triggers killing a worker when we have appreciably below the
            ooo_balance number of frames.

            For example, 0.6 means that even if we don't have enough ooo
            frames, but we only processed 60% of the received images in a given
            period, we should spawn another worker in anticipation of the
            number of ooo frames growing excessively.
        kill_worker_threshold_high (float): analagous to
            kill_worker_threshold_high except when we have sufficiently many
            out of order frames.

            For example, 0.8 means that if we have enough ooo frames but we
            only processed 80% of the incoming images in a given window, then
            we should kill a worker to prevent getting too many more ooo
            frames.

        ooo_balance (int): the minimum number of frames that puts us into
            the high threshold for the above parameters.
        ooo_cap (int): the number of out of order frames that causes us to
            stop releasing jobs until we fall below. It should be much
            larger than the balance since killing workers is a much more
            efficient way to reduce out of order frames
        ooo_error (int): the number of out of order frames that causes
            us to error.
        min_frames_per_sync (int): the minimum number of frames per sync,
            regardless of how (non)confident we are that we have achieved
            a balance of dispatching jobs and working
        max_frames_per_sync (int): the maximum number of frames per sync,
            regardless of how confident we are that we have achieved a
            balance of dispatching jobs and working.


        frame_batch_min_improvement (float): the minimum performance improvemnt
            for us to increment the frame batch amount. for example, 1.1 means
            we will increase the frame batch size up to the point where doing
            so gives us less than 10% improvement in performance. Use 1 + eps
            to increase if theres any performance.
        frame_batch_max_badness (float): the maximum detected performance
            reduction before we reduce the frame batch amount. For example,
            0.9 means that if we can reduce the frame batch size and keep 90%
            of performance than we should do so
        frame_batch_dyn_min_decay_time (float): the number of seconds before
            a dynamic minimum decays by 1, meaning we retry a minimum
        frame_batch_dyn_max_decay_time (float): the number of seconds before
            a dynamic maximum decays by 1, meaning we retry a maximum
        frame_batch_min (int): the minimum frame batch size
        frame_batch_max (int): the maximum frame batch size. it should be noted
            that in general more frame batches means more out of order frames,
            so increasing this should involve increasing ooo_balance and
            ooo_cap.
